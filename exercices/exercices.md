# Exercices

## Exercise 1: Swap Two Variables

Write a Python program that swaps the values of two variables without using a temporary variable. For example, if `x` is 5 and `y` is 10, after swapping, `x` should be 10 and `y` should be 5.

> Hint: See the code of this markdown file.
<!-- Hint : You can use multiple assignment to swap two variables in Python. -->

## Exercise 2: Palindrome Checker

Create a Python function that checks whether a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

> Hint: See the code of this markdown file.
<!-- Hint : You can use the `reversed()` function to reverse a string in Python. -->

## Exercise 3: Factorial Calculation

Write a Python program to calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer entered by the user. Ensure that the program handles input validation and provides the result.

> Hint: See the code of this markdown file.
<!-- Hint : You can use recursion to calculate the factorial of a number in Python. -->

## Exercise 4: Fibonacci Sequence

Create a Python function that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two previous numbers.

> Hint: See the code of this markdown file.
<!-- Hint : You can use recursion to generate the Fibonacci sequence in Python. -->

## Exercise 5: Print Comb

Write a Python program that prints all possible combinations of two digits between 012 and 789. The digits of left should always be less than the digits on the right.
This reminds you something ?

> No hint for the last one, you can do it !

## Exercise 6: Decorators

This is a function `say_hello`.
```python
@repeat(3)
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")
```

Create a Python decorator that repeats the function call n times. In this example, the function should be called three times.
