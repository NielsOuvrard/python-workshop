## 1. Swap Two Variables

Write a Python program that swaps the values of two variables without using a temporary variable. For example, if `x` is 5 and `y` is 10, after swapping, `x` should be 10 and `y` should be 5.

## 2. Palindrome Checker

Create a Python function that checks whether a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

## 3. Fibonacci Sequence

Create a Python function that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two previous numbers.

It begins like this: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

## 4. Print Comb

Write a Python program that prints all possible combinations of two digits between 012 and 789. The digits of left should always be less than the digits on the right.

## 5. Repeat Function Call

This is a function `say_hello`.
```python
# use this function

@repeat(3)
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")
```

Create a Python `repeat` that repeats the function call n times. In this example, the function should be called three times.

## 6. Recreate the `range` function

Create a Python function that takes up to three arguments and returns a list of numbers in the specified range.
The function should work similarly to Python's built-in `range` function.
