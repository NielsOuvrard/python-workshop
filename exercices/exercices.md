## 1. Swap Two Variables

Write a Python program that swaps the values of two variables without using a temporary variable. For example, if `x` is 5 and `y` is 10, after swapping, `x` should be 10 and `y` should be 5.

## 2. Palindrome Checker

Create a Python function that checks whether a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

## 3. Fibonacci Sequence

Create a Python function that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two previous numbers.

It begins like this: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

## 5. Repeat Function Call

This is a function `say_hello`.
```python
# use this function

@repeat(3)
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")
```

Create a Python `repeat` that repeats the function call n times. In this example, the function should be called three times.

## 6. Recreate the `range` function

Create a Python function that takes up to three arguments and returns a list of numbers in the specified range.
The function should work similarly to Python's built-in `range` function.

## 7. Dictionary Manipulation

You are given a dictionary representing information about books in a library.

```python
library_books = {
    'book1': {'title': 'Python Basics', 'author': 'John Smith', 'genre': 'Programming'},
    'book2': {'title': 'Data Science Essentials', 'author': 'Alice Johnson', 'genre': 'Data Science'},
    'book3': {'title': 'History of Science', 'author': 'Michael Turner', 'genre': 'History'},
    'book4': {'title': 'Cooking Mastery', 'author': 'Emily White', 'genre': 'Cooking'},
    'book5': {'title': 'Artificial Intelligence', 'author': 'David Lee', 'genre': 'Programming'},
}
```

1. Add a new book to the library called `book6` with the title `Gardening for Beginners`, the author `Sarah Smith`, and the genre `Gardening`.
2. Remove `book3` from the library.
3. Change the genre of `book4` to `Cooking Basics`.
4. Print the titles of all the books in the library.
5. Print the author of `book1`.
6. Return a book containing the title `Data Science Essentials`.
7. Check if the library contains a book called `Cryptography`.
8. Creating a new dictionary `programming_books` containing all books with the genre `Programming`.

## 8 Tuple Manipulation

You are given a tuple representing the temperatures in Celsius for a week.

```python
temperatures = (30, 32, 28, 22, 30, 29, 24)
```

1. Find the `average` temperature for the week.
2. Find the `maximum` temperature for the week.
3. Which day had the minimum temperature for the week?
4. Check if the temperatures list contains a temperature of `27`.
5. What was the temperature on Thursday?
6. Create a new tuple with temperatures in Fahrenheit.

```python
# Your code here

# After your code, print the results
print("Average Temperature:", average_temperature)
print("Maximum Temperature:", max_temperature)
print("Minimum Temperature is on", min_temperature_day)
print("Is 27 present?", is_27_present)
print("Temperature on Thursday:", thursday_temperature)
print("Temperatures in Fahrenheit:", temperatures_fahrenheit)
```
